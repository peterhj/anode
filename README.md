# anode

`anode` is a framework for constructing dataflow graphs and enabling efficient
automatic differentiation of dataflow graphs. `anode` is analogous to projects
like Theano, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

Unlike other similar frameworks, `anode` is particularly dedicated to making
multi-GPU and distributed execution as easy and efficient as possible on common
systems, including single multi-GPU boxes, GPU instances in the cloud, and
clusters connected by fast interconnects.
